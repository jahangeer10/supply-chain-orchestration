- ✅ Detects demand spikes and anomalies
- ✅ Provides recommendations for inventory adjustments

#### 2. **Inventory Management Agent**
- ✅ Monitors stock levels across all warehouses
- ✅ Identifies low stock and overstock situations
- ✅ Calculates optimal reorder quantities
- ✅ Optimizes inventory distribution

#### 3. **Logistics Optimization Agent**
- ✅ Monitors shipment status and delays
- ✅ Optimizes shipping routes and carrier selection
- ✅ Identifies delivery bottlenecks
- ✅ Provides cost optimization recommendations

#### 4. **Orchestrator Agent**
- ✅ Coordinates all agents and workflows
- ✅ Prioritizes recommendations across agents
- ✅ Makes final decisions based on agent inputs
- ✅ Maintains decision audit trail
